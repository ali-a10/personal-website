				<h1>Welcome</h1>
				<p>
					I’m a second year University of Toronto student seeking to
					gain work experience this summer as an intern. I am currently
					majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics and
					Business, Science and Entrepreneurship with a GPA of 3.78.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have a great passion for technology and coding, especially
					learning new languages that can perform different tasks.
					This was what I focused on this winter break as I learned
					how to code in HTML, CSS, Flask and BeautifulSoup to create
					websites and extract data from the web.  In the future, I
					hope to become more proficient in the languages I know and
					learn other languages such as C++ and JavaScript to be more
					versatile.
				</p>
				<p>
					Apart from my technical skills, I’m looking forward to
					developing my systems analysis and software development
					skills in a working environment. Alongside that, I’m excited
					to apply my analytical, communication and problem-solving
					skills in a professional workplace.
				</p>
